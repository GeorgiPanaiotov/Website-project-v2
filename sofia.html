                        The Ivan Vazov National Theatre is Bulgaria's national theatre, as well as the<br>
                        oldest and most authoritative theatre in the country and one of the important<br>
                        landmarks of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. It is located in the centre of the city,<br>
                        with the facade facing the City Garden. A postcard before 1926 with some of the<br>
                        leading actors in the Theater. Founded in 1904 by the artists from the Salza i Smyah<br>
                        company, it was initially called simply the National Theatre, but before being named<br>
                        after the prominent writer Ivan Vazov it also bore the name of Krastyu Sarafov between<br>
                        1952 and 1962. Vazov's play The Outcasts was the first to be performed at the theatre when<br>
                        it opened. The theatre's Neoclassical building, designed by famous Viennese theatre architects<br>
                        Hermann Helmer and Ferdinand Fellner, was finished in 1906 and opened on 3 January 1907.<br>
                        The building was extensively damaged by a fire in 1923 during an anniversary celebration,<br>
                        but was reconstructed in 1929 by German architect Martin DÃ¼lfer.
