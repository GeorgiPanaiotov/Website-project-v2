                    The Church of the Holy Mother of God, full name Cathedral Church of the Dormition of the Holy Mother<br>
                    of God is a Bulgarian National Revival church in Bulgaria's second largest city Plovdiv. The church<br>
                    is situated in the Old town of Plovdiv on one of the city's seven hills, Nebet Tepe. A small church<br>
                    existed on the site as early as the 9th century. The church was renovated in 1186 by the bishop of Plovdiv<br>
                    Constantine Pantehi and it became part of a monastery. Both the church and the monastery were destroyed when<br>
                    the Ottoman Turks conquered the city in 1371 in the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars.

                    Dzhumaya Mosque is located in Plovdiv, Plovdiv Province, Bulgaria. Its Turkish name is Hüdavendigâr Camii<br>
                    or Cuma Camii. The mosque is located in the centre of Plovdiv and was built in 1363–1364 on the site<br>
                    of the Sveta Petka Tarnovska Cathedral Church after the conquest of Plovdiv by the Ottoman army. During the<br>
                    reign of Sultan Murad I in the 15th century the old building was demolished and replaced by the modern-day mosque.<br>
                    It was called Ulu Dzhumaya Mosque, or Main Friday Mosque. The mosque is large, with nine domes and a 33 m × 27 m<br>
                    prayer hall. There is a minaret at the northeast corner of the main façade. Interior wall paintings date to the<br>
                    late 18th to early 19th centuries.

                    The Cathedral of St Louis is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria.<br>
                    Co-cathedral of the Diocese of Sofia and Plovdiv together with the Cathedral of St Joseph in Sofia,<br>
                    it is one of the largest and most important Roman Catholic places of worship in the country. It was named<br>
                    after Louis IX of France, commonly known as "Saint Louis". The cathedral was constructed in the 1850s,<br>
                    during the time of vicar Andrea Canova. The first organ in Bulgaria was installed in the cathedral in 1861,<br>
                    later replaced with a newer and larger one. A fire severely damaged the cathedral in 1931 and destroyed the<br>
                    wood-carved ceiling. The cathedral was reconstructed, with Krastyo Stamatov creating the frescoes and<br>
                    Kamen Petkov being the main architect. The cathedral was once again inaugurated on 8 May 1932. Architecturally,<br>
                    it features an eclectic combination of Neoclassicism and Neo-Baroque.

                    he Odeon of Philippopolis was the house of the city council of citizens (known as bouleuterion)<br>
                    of ancient Plovdiv. It was also used as a theatre due to its appropriate structure. The Odeon buildings<br>
                    had four construction periods: from the 2nd century AD (during the reign of Hadrian) when it was initially<br>
                    built to the 4th century AD when it was abandoned. The existence of such a building in ancient Plovdiv is<br>
                    a sign for the importance of Philippopolis as a cultural and political centre. Evidence of the 250/1<br>
                    destruction by the Goths has been discovered around the Odeon.
